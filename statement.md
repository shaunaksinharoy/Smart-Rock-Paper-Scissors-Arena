# Project Statement

**Problem:** Traditional RPS is random. Can we build an intelligent opponent using only logic programming and knowledge representation in Prolog?

**Scope:** Implement a complete RPS system in SWI-Prolog with rule-based AI that learns player tendencies using dynamic predicates – directly applying CO6 (Prolog Programming) and CO2 (Knowledge Representation).

**Target Users:** Students learning AI, Logic Programming enthusiasts

**High-level Features:**
1. Interactive gameplay with input validation
2. Rule-based intelligent opponent
3. Dynamic learning from game history
4. Strategy adaptation using backtracking and facts
